# Camping-API

This application combines multiple APIs:
* OpenCage Geocoder
* HikingProject
* Mapbox
* OpenWeatherMap

These API's allow a user to get all sorts of information about hiking trails anywhere in the world.
You can search a location and receive a list of nearby trails, and can select specific trails to get a map of the area or the current 5 day forecast.
You can also save a location and bookmark it for later, and view all the trails you have bookmarked.
